Moodle Plugin for merging pdf files in a course<br>

The ‘Merge PDF Files’ plugin offers the user a convenient way by which he/she can merge the files (only PDF documents) in a Moodle course. <br>
This plugin requires 2 tools:<br>
 * PDFtk (short for PDF Toolkit) is a cross-platform tool for manipulating Portable Document Format (PDF) documents. It comes in three flavors: PDFtk Free, PDFtk Pro, and a command-line tool PDFtk Server.<br>
 * LaTeX – A document preparation system for high-quality typesetting. It is most often used for medium-to-large technical or scientific documents but it can be used for almost any form of publishing.<br>

The module is created and is currently being worked upon at IIT, Bombay (India). <br>
